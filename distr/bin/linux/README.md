# Utilities

Utilities to create B2JF binaries on linux and macosx.

The utilities can be used to create c64 binaries that run any platform that supports VICE 3.5 or real C64.

You can also generate b2fj.prg binary and but it on a online C64 emulator (https://c64emulator.111mb.de/)

The linux generated binaries can only run on 32-bits platforms, or 64-bit with 32-bit libraries installed.

## b2fj-go-optimizer

Optimizes the classes.jar file, using proguard opensource java optimization tools.

This optimization give us 2k extra room (aprox.) for our applications running on the device.

## b2fj-go-c64 <File>

Compile source, link, create binary native image and run on C64 VICE 3.5

## b2fj-go-atari <File>

Compile source, link, create binary native image and run on Atari800 emulator.

try:
$ cd <B2FJ_HOME>/dev/test
$ b2fj-go-atari b2fJ/test/atari/PlayerMissileTest

## b2fj-go-linux <File>

Compiles, link, creates binary native image and run on Linux.

## b2fj-compiler <File.java>

Compiles the source to a .class using the B2JF classes.

## b2fj-linker <File>

Link the classes in a single byte array and generates a java_code on distr/src/javavm to be compiled in a single native image.

## b2fj-native-c64

Generates b2fj.prg binary native image that can run on C64.

## b2fj-native-linux

Generates a 32-bit binary native image that can run on linux and debbuged with gdb.

# Linux

It is possible to use the linux utilities to create a C64 native image and run it on the VICE emulator. 

If the linux has OS 32-bit support, is possible run the native images for testing and debug previous to run on a real device.

The linux binaries requires 32-bit supports as it assumes that the host machine has 32-bit addresses, in a 64-bit environment the binaries crash due the addresses are truncated.

The utilities has been tested on Ubuntu and Raspbian

## Prerrequisites

sudo apt install vice
sudo apt install cc65
sudo apt install atari800

sudo apt install build-essential gcc-multilib
# Step for 64-bit linux
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 # add packages to run 32-bit binaries
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install libc6-i386
sudo apt install libc6:i386 libstdc++6:i386
sudo apt install gcc-multilib # for 64-bit linux to build 32-bit binaries

# OSX

It is possible to use the linux utilities to create a C64 native image and run it on the VICE emulator on Mac OSX (tested on Catalina).

OSX does not have 32-bit support, the is not possible run the native images on this platform, just in the VICE emulator.

1. Prerrequisites

brew install vice
brew install cc65
brew install atari800

# Quick Start

1. Install and correctly configure the prerrequisites (the command x64sc should open the VICE emulator).
2. Clone the B2JF repository.
3. Execute the following commands:

cd ./distr/bin/linux
export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
b2fj-go-c64 HelloWorld # Build the binary and run in the emulator
